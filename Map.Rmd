## R Markdown

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet. 

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 

```{r}
library(leaflet)
library(htmltools)
```

## Make map

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=43.1594, lng= -79.2469, popup="My Office")
my_map
```
